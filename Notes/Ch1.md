 
*“I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. ......
What you know about computing other people will learn. Don’t feel as if the key to successful
computing is only in your hands. What’s in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to
see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.”*

by *[Alan J. Perlis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Perlis)*

Programs must be written for people to **read**, and only **incidentally for machines to execute**. ......Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that ‘‘computer science’’ is not a science and
that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way
we think and in the way we express what we think.
