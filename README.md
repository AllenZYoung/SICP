# Introduction
These are my codes and learning notes for reading SICP (the Wizard Book).

# Some important things
My reading project started in Nov, 2015, and I don't know how long it will take to finish it. 
I have both the English ver (in PDF format) and the Chinese ver (which I bought in an online secondhand bookstore).  
The notes for sections (might be in markdown format) and the code comments will be mainly in English 
(with a little Chinese, you know, I don't really like to use Chinese in technical fields though it's my mother tongue). 

I'm willing to implement codes, for every important example, question and thoughts in the book. 
The tool software of mine is [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/), 
and the suggestion [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19546115/which-lang-packet-is-proper-for-sicp-in-dr-racket) is very awesome. Don't forget to visit the [MIT press page](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) for more information.
